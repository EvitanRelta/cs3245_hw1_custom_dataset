# Custom dataset for CS3245 HW1

Text is taken from malaysian/indonesian news websites, and ChatGPT for tamil (since I couldn't find online tamil text in latin characters) and for the 2 "other" languages: Na'vi from Avatar and Klingon from Star Trek.

- `generate.py`, source code for generating the dataset.
- `input.custom_test.txt`, unlabelled dataset for prediction.
- `input.custom_correct.txt`, labelled dataset for checking predictions.
